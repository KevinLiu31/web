   <h2 class="largo">ANIMATION</h2>
   <p>Pokemon has many animations, from Pokemon origin to smaller series such as pokemon legend, but none is more well known than Ash Ketchum’s journey. His journey stretches over 23 seasons and 20 movies.</p>

<h2>ANIME</h2>
    <p> The Pokemon anime was first release on April 1, 1997. It follows the main character Ash Ketchum, as he explore different regions, take on gym challenges 
    and try to become a pokemon master. He starts off without one of the three kanto starters, but with a pikachu, because he slept in. On the way to the first
      gym, he met Misty, whose bike he destroyed, he then challenge the first gym, after he defeated the gym, the leader Brock came with Ash and Misty
      on their pokemon Journey. Through out the journey through kanto, Ash capture many pokemon and defeat all 8 gyms, and made the pokemon league, but sadly only placed
      top 16. The group then went to Jhoto, where another journey happen. Next is Honen, where Misty is replace with another female character May, and her little
      brother joined the journey. In the Honen region we were introduced to the pokemon beauty contest. At the end of the journey May and Max split with brock
      and Ash. Ash and Brook then went to the Sinoh region, where they meet Dawn who joined them. In this league, Ash placed top 4. Following which Ash went
      to the Unova region, and parted ways with Brock. There he was met with Iris and Cilan, who joined him, in his journey. He then went to Kalos where he was 
      met with his childhood friend (and lover) Serena, and Clemont and his sister Bonnie joined as well. Following this, he went to alola, where he met a whole
      new cast of people, this season was different as there were no gym. After this, was pokemon Journey which is also very different as there is no selected region. If you want to find out more:

	   <h2> MOVIES </h2>
		   <p> The pokemon movies mostly don’t have impact on the anime, but the anime does have impact on the movies. The movie will use Ash’s current pokemon team when the timelines overlap. Most of the movies focus on legendaries, which are usually not talked about in the anime. Each movie has their own plot which usually involves Ash and his friends interacting with the legendaries. I will be listing the first 12 here: The first movie and the most iconic was “Pokemon:The First Movie” It featured the legendary pokemon mew and mewtwo. The second focuses on lugia and the bird trios: Moltres, articuno, and zapdos. The third focuses on the dog trios: Entei, suicune, and Raiku. The fourth focuses on celebi, the fifth focus on latios and latias, the sixth focus on jirachi, the seventh focus on deoxys and rayquaza, the eighth focus on mew again, the ninth focus on manaphy, the tenth focus on victini and Zekrom, the eleventh focus on reshiram. </p>
