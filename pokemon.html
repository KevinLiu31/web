 The original pokemon red, blue, and green game was released in Japan on February 27, 1996. It was then released in the USA on September 28 1998 as Pokemon red and 
 blue, with green not being released. The game came out for the Nintendo gameboy. It has sold 300 million copes world wide. The company game freak, has seen 
 released 30 more games, across multiple hand held consoles. The basis of the game is simple, you are a 10 year old child, trying to be the very best pokemon
 trainer in the world. To do this you engage in pokemon battles, where you fight other people's pokemon with your pokemon. You will engage in larger gym battles 
 where you will gain badges, with typically 8 badges in each game. When you have all 8, you will  then fight the elite 4 and then the champion, to take the title of 
 the very best. You start off with a choice of 1 out of 3 starter pokemon, and you catch more along the way.
