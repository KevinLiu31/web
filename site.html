	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
	<p> Unless you have been living under a rock, you would have heard of pokemon, the franchise originating in the early 90s. The franchise has grown at a rapid rate since its release, selling hundred of millions of their games. The franchise has grown and branched out into many fields: manga, anime, video-game, AR, trading card, and toys, movies. This page was made to give an overview of the franchise, and try to give a brief introduction to different parts of the franchise. This page was not intended as a guide, as there is far too much information to cover. This page will give you a breif on the games, toys (including trading cards), and anime (including movies). As the manga isnâ€™t as popular, we will not be covering it. </p>
