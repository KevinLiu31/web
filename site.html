	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
	<p1> Pokemon, the franchise arising from the early 90s, that fascinated and inspired many. I've always love pokemon, from when I watched the first episode to the newest game. This page intend to give a brief overview of pokemon, and it's three main products, the video game, anime, and trading card. This page is not intended as a guide, for there is too much information stretching through 4 decades, and hundreds of products and spinoffs. It will however give you the barebone basic for anyone that is trying to get into the franchise! </p1>
