    <h2 class="largo">VIDEO GAME</h2>
   
  <p> Throughout the franchise there have been numerous types of games from pokemon snap to pokemon go, but the most popular ones are the pokemon rpg games and pokemon go. This section will only go over these two popular types.</p>
    <h2> RPG GAMES </h2>
    <p>These rpg (role playing games) pokemon games all generally follow the same formatting. In this world when kids reach the age of 10, they get to choose one out of three starter pokemons to start their pokemon journey. You are a child who just reached the age of 10, your first task almost always is to go to the lab and pick your first pokemon! Your task is to become the very best in the region, by defeating the champion! To do this you must defeat 8 gyms and collect 8 badges to challenge the elite four and then the champions. In most gyms there is a puzzle which you must solve to get to the gym leader and challenge him. There is always an overlapping plot to this main goal, there is an evil team in every game who is trying to end the world, steal pokemon, or just trying to get in your way. One of your tasks in the game is to defeat the evil team and prevent them from achieving their goals. Throughout the game you will catch and train pokemon, battle trainers, and gather items to help you on your journey.The Original Pokemon game was released in Japan on February 27, 1996 as Pokemon Red, Blue, and Green. But when it was released in the USA on September 28, 1998, only Pokemon Blue and Pokemon Red were brought overseas. The game saw tremendous success selling more than 300 million copies world wide. And since the Original games, they have released 30 other RPG pokemon games since, with every game including a new plot and new pokemons. This number will soon rise with the announcement of Pokemon Shiny Pearl and Brilliant Diamond setting to release late 2021.

 	<h2>POKEMON GO </h2>
     <p> Pokemon Go, the AR pokemon game that took the world by storm in the summer of 2016. This game brought the world of pokemon to real life. The game used augmented reality in order to do this. The game is also quite simple. You start off by catching a starter pokemon, but unlike the RPG games, pokemon go requires you to flick a pokeball at the pokemon in order to watch it, of course the pokemon has a chance of escaping. The game requires you to run around your neighborhood hunting down pokemon. This game took a whole different approach to gyms, at lvl 5 you could choose what team you want to be on, mystic, valor, or instinct, in this game these three teams try to control gyms and gain reward from them. The battle system is also different, instead of selecting moves, this game requires you to tap attack and charge up more powerful moves to use them. It also added in pokestop, areas which you could do to and get items such as pokeballs. The game at itâ€™s peak had a billion downloads worldwide.</p>
